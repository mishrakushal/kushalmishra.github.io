Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet 🌐.

I'm Kushal, and I'm 23 years old. I work as a risk analyst at [JPMorganChase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), where I get to solve real-world problems, and brainstorm alongside some of the most brilliant minds in the world of finance. I enjoy puzzles 🧩, and consider myself a lifelong learner with a passion for building (and breaking and again re-building) 🛠️ things that make life easier. In an era of vibe-coders armed by ChatGPT and Claude, I enjoy writing code myself 👨🏻‍💻 and am always ready to dive in whenever I see a big, red `error`.

## Work

My day-to-day involves diving into large datasets, building things to make life easier for our teams, and frequently going down rabbit holes that start with _“why does this metric look weird?”_ 🤔

Over the past year, I’ve gotten to work on some pretty exciting things—ranging from automation pipelines and mathematical models, to building dashboards 📊 and AI-powered tools.

While my current title says “analyst,” I’ve also dabbled in full-on software engineering, ML experimentation, and just enough DevOps to be dangerous. I'm always hungry to learn, ship, and level up ⬆️.

## Education

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science 🎓 from [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) where I spent 4 wonderful years and made some amazing friends.

Academically, I wasn’t a topper, but I was always curious and willing to get my hands dirty. I explored blockchain research, built side projects that broke more often than they worked, and wrote just enough papers 📝 to pretend I understood what I was doing. Looking back, college wasn’t just about lectures—it was about learning how to learn, and that’s a skill I carry with me everywhere.

## Interests

When I’m not buried in code or debugging logs, you’ll probably find me swimming 🏊🏻‍♂️,&nbsp; lost in a good book 📖, &nbsp;watching cricket 🏏,&nbsp; or staring out the window with my headphones on 🎧 and brain turned off.

This site is a collection of my work, my interests, and the journey in between. Thanks for stopping by—feel free to reach out, collaborate, or just say hi!
