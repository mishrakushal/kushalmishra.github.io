## Music 🎧

I love music, and there rarely ever comes a day when I don't listen to it. I go crazy about Indian Classical fusions with Metal / Rock 🎸.

Currently listening to "honest" on repeat. I really like the live version:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
  <iframe 
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DzTQLHKI78?si=k103_w8LSjUEkoG7" 
    title="YouTube video player" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" 
    allowfullscreen 
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
  </iframe>
</div> <br>
Some of my go-to stuff to listen to:
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; overflow-x: auto; gap: 16px; padding: 8px;">

## Sports 🏏

I'm a huge fan of cricket and the Indian cricket team. Test cricket is my favourite format of the game — partly because I find it a lot like life: have a bad day, shrug it off, show up stronger tomorrow :)

I've also quite recently picked up bowling 🎳 on the weekends! The highest I've scored in a single round is 137.

## Reading 📚

I try to read a book a month, but I don't meet this mark as much as I'd like to. The last book I read was [Creative Selection by Ken Kocienda](https://g.co/kgs/fFzjRz5) which gives an amazing recount of the earlier days of Apple when the (now taken-for-granted) features such as autocorrect and "slide to unlock" were still being developed. Currently reading [The Second World War by Antony Beevor](https://g.co/kgs/xvkpZfh).

## TV shows and movies 🎥

I usually don't have time to binge every new series that comes out, so I often resort to my comfort shows such as Brooklyn 99, Modern Family, and The Office (US). I'm also into a few anime such as Jujutsu Kaisen, Solo Levelling, and One Punch Man.
